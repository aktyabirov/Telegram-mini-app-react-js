**Telegram Mini App - ReactJS Template (JavaScript)**
This is a JavaScript version of the Telegram Mini App ReactJS Template, which was originally built using TypeScript. We've converted the project from TypeScript to JavaScript to simplify usage for developers who prefer working in JavaScript.

Overview
This template provides a foundation for building Telegram Mini Apps using React and Vite. It integrates Telegram's Mini App SDK (@telegram-apps/sdk-react) to make it easier to access Telegram features.

***Changes from the Original***
***Converted all TypeScript files (.ts and .tsx) to JavaScript (.js and .jsx). ***
***Removed TypeScript configurations (such as tsconfig.json and TypeScript-specific plugins).***
***All functionality remains the same, but now with a JavaScript codebase.***
